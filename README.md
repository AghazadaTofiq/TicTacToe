# Tic-Tac-Toe Game


## Description
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe developed in Unity, a popular game engine. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.


## Features

Player vs. Player: Two human players can compete against each other.

Interactive Interface: Simple and intuitive UI to make moves and track game progress.

Win Detection: Automatically detects when a player has won or when the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play

Launch the game.

The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.

Two players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) in an available cell by clicking on the grid.

The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

If the grid is filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
